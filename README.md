# Electricity-Demand-Prediction-through-Neural-Network

Electricity consumption is an important economic index and plays a significant role in drawing up an energy development policy for each country. To obtain an accurate forecasting of demand, a more sophisticated model is required, which can take in to account various non-linearities present in historical demand and other featured data. This project deploys a simple deep neural network to predict the hourly electricity consumption of 'Scafie building" in the Carnegie Mellon University.
